*It takes two to tango*, but in Wodiyamado, it takes all of us. It’s the measured sway and swing of each of our limbs that makes up the dance towards our goals symphonic.

As mentioned by Rotary International, it is every Rotaractor’s common belief that exemplifying and embracing diversity, equity, and inclusion should be a part of everything we do. The unified voice of our community upholds the virtues of a service giver, vowing in our every action to make the world a tad bit better. Our diversity, however, never have and never will become a hindrance to our dedicated walk towards our end goal. Hereby, we kick start our monthly blog by venerating this year’s World Population Day.

World Population Day is an annual event that emphasizes the diversity of the global population. It serves as a reminder of the importance in recognizing and appreciating the various cultures, traditions, and backgrounds that make up our world. This day is an opportunity to reflect on the unique contributions that individuals from different parts of the world bring to society, and to promote understanding and acceptance of diversity. Taking our club as an instance, it is crystal clear that we have diverse ideological, educational, and even financial backgrounds, which we are and can utilize to lift up the undermined potentials of many.

The significance of World Population Day lies in its emphasis on the value of inclusivity and respect for all people, regardless of whatever outlying feature they may have. As Rotaractors, we should use this day as a platform to raise awareness about the challenges and opportunities that come with a diverse group like Wodiyamado, let alone the global population. By recognizing and celebrating diversity on this day with a sense of unity among people from all walks of life, we can foster our goals lying Wodiyamado and bring them closer with every united step.

Thereof, we end this month’s blog by inviting you to tango with us with an intricate footwork and precise movements with coordination and communication towards our shared goal.

Cheers to the new Rotary Year,

Bethlehem Negussie, Head of Content Writing
