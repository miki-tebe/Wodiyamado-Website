Imagine a blistering afternoon, when thirst grips you hard, and water is nowhere to be found.
Yes, that is painful! But do you know what is even more painful?! After hours of searching, When
you find out, the only water you get is unhygienic and unsafe to drink.

Unfortunate?! No, this is in fact a daily reality of millions around the globe. And that is why we
should talk about WASH more and more. But what is there to talk about?

It is commonly said that access to clean and hygienic water can be considered a human right.
Though the truth about its affordability begs a big question in our current time. We don’t just
need water-we need it to be safe, clean and healthy. Thus WASH (Water, Sanitation, and
Hygiene) is an essential focus for global health. Without proper sanitation and hygiene, not only
is the well-being of individuals at risk, but the safety of the world as a whole comes into
question.

This insight emphasizes the importance of Incorporating WASH education into early science
curricula so that Children evolve with knowledge of necessity of proper WASH practices, making
them advocates for health in their homes and communities. Do you remember our childhood
favorite song? I bet you do–
'Are you sleeping, are you sleeping, Brother John, Brother John?
Morning bells are ringing, morning bells are ringing...
' Nostalgic, right? It is Brother Jacob,In the
Amharic version, and it comes with his reply: 'I will wake up, I will wake up, After washing my
face, eating my breakfast, I will go to school...
' This song not only gave us a memorable and
cheerful upbringing, but it also laid the foundation for lifelong healthy habits. Just look at Jacob's
words-despite knowing how scary it is to face our teachers when we’re late for class, he still
insists on washing his face before anything else. It has a deep message within it: hygiene
should never be an afterthought but an essential routine. Of course, that little boy Jacob is a
troublesome child who even dares to add breakfast to his routine-but hey, no judgment!"

While songs like this instill early habits of sanitation, they cannot mask the Severe reality that
many children grow up without reliable access to clean water. Yes, Education alone is not
enough-without the infrastructures, even the most well-taught lessons remain unattainable in
practice.

Having visited rural parts of Ethiopia several times, I’ve had no choice but to witness how
access to water differs drastically from the city. The water we usually take for granted-the one
that freely flows from our taps-requires hours of physical effort and labor in many areas. Young
children walk very long distances carrying heavy containers in their back, sometimes twice their
weight, only to reach a water source that may not even be safe to drink. It’s a tough reality, hard
to accept but one that highlights the urgency of improving WASH infrastructure and accessibility.
After all Clean water is not just a matter of convenience-it’s a matter of well-being and life.

So, now the right question should be followed like this :how can we contribute to global efforts
for better health and sanitation? good news! change starts with small, personal actions with the
youth, with every single person. Prioritizing hygiene within households ensures beyond personal
health, safety for whole families and communities. Raising awareness by discussing WASH
issues whenever we get the opportunity, advocating for better policies, and supporting
organizations working to improve access to clean water can be the solution that can create
lasting impact. Additionally, personal responsibility and intentional water use, sustainable and
conservation practices play a crucial role in making sure clean water remains accessible for
generations to come. Our collective actions add up leading to significant change in the world. An
entire community benefits when one individual makes hygiene a priority.

Let's wash! Let's shine! Let's stay clean and healthy!

Why? Because every drop of effort fills the bucket of change. And don’t forget–the healthier world
we all wish to see starts with you, with us!
