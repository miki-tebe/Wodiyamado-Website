When&nbsp;youth's sweet luminescent dawn subsides to dusk's overbearing darkness, time crawls under the youthful skin of existence until it loosens it from the flesh it is attached to. Early birds feed on the shining glow of the youthful soul each day. They tweet their excitement, which never dies, to the world first thing in the morning. Their chirp then lets up as they migrate in search of their morning feed. Their early warble is so much like the youth, full of energy and ready to conquer the world. The never-ending hope for a better day in their captivating melodies resembles that of the young adults’ eagerness to experience life wholesomely.&nbsp;

Today, we celebrate youth by aiming for sustainable development using digital pathways. In the process of ever-going self-discovery and growth, the youth of today can harness the power of innovation to create a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future by embracing digital pathways and addressing the associated challenges. This day recognizes the youth’s pivotal role and provides a platform to highlight their ideas and aspirations.

In the same manner that the welding power of the goldsmith dictates the shape of the iron, we, the youth, hold a similar power in modeling the world. As Robert Frost put it, nothing gold can stay. It is completely up to us to prevent our golden years from withering away. In vibrant hues, let your youthful dreams take flight. Let your aspirations soar high up in the sky, and don’t let the disruptive cry of the crows make you miss the high plateau to land upon.&nbsp;

As we close this month's post, let's remind ourselves that we need to create a place where young people like us can thrive. In the event that we are unable to make such a setting, we can help by not being a hindrance to&nbsp;others'&nbsp;efforts.
