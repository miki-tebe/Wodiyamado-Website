          education - Leadership learning, how to motivate, influence and lead
          leaders. Continuing Education: Rotaract is a learning opportunity and
          is a continuous training in doing research and assessment of critical
          community needs, strategizing, developing plans, creating and managing
          teams and other resources, raising funds, and celebrating
          achievements. This is complete and comprehensive education in
          developing multifarious management skills encompassing management of
          resources, production, humans, finances, publicity, promotions, and
          projects. Professional Network: This is a significant advantage which

          especially when a young boy and girl wish to work as an intern or is
          looking for a job after studies. Rotary’s network of business people

          becoming a Rotaractor, the chance to do something for somebody else;
          to sense the self-fulfillment that comes in the process, and the
          return of that satisfaction to one's own life. It’s richly rewarded.

          spirit of giving, and ethical behavior, which augurs well generally
